APU:
  - Ensure sweep is correct
  - Ensure linear counter is correct
  - Implement proper mixing using table lookup

  - High frequency sounds don't sound right because APU frequency is not divisble by 44100Hz
    - Pulse, Noise & DMC, where t > 48 should in theory sound fine (nyquist-shannon)
    - Triangle, where t > 24 should in theory sound fine (nyquist-shannon)
    - But for some reason the audio still sounds off at higher values of t

CPU:
  - Review and refactor: add/sub, shifts, jsr/rts, php, plp
  - Handle page crossing for calculating # of cycles
  - Handle CPU bug

Memory mapping (p.11):
  - Handle I/O registers ($2000-$4020)
    - $2008-$4000 are mirrors of $2000-$2007
  - Expansion ROM ($4020-$6000)
  - SRAM ($6000-$6000)
  - PRG_ROM ($8000-$10000)
    - Possibly rename prg_rom_size to prg_rom_banks
    - prg_rom_size > 2: must use a memory mapper to determine which 16kb banks to load into memory
    - Handle interrupt vectors from $FFFA-$FFFF
